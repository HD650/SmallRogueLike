all stuff in a scene are objects

objects are defined by attributes in object.attributes["attr_name"], attributes are mainly introduced to object by abilities and keywords

abilities define the behaviour (code) and all relative attributes (variables) a behaviour may need
objects with same abilities can perform some interaction like combat, talking
abilities decouple interaction between objects, the interaction code and relative variables are all located at abilities class, not the object itself
positive abilities can be perform when user or AI command them to, passive abilities will perform automatically

keywords are sets of abilities and may modify some specific variable to make abilities special
object holds keywords to decorate themselves, keywords can add additional attributes and abilities to an object
